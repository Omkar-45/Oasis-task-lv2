            <h2>A brief summary of Dr. Subhash Chandra Bose's journey</h2>
            <h3>Early life and education</h3>
            <p>
                The son of a wealthy and prominent Bengali lawyer, Bose studied at Presidency College, Calcutta (Kolkata), from which he was expelled in 1916 for nationalist activities, and the Scottish Churches College (graduating in 1919). He then was sent by his parents
                to the University of Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil Service. In 1920 he passed the civil service examination, but in April 1921, after hearing of the nationalist turmoils in India, he resigned his candidacy and hurried
                back to India. Throughout his career, especially in its early stages, he was supported financially and emotionally by an elder brother, Sarat Chandra Bose (1889–1950), a wealthy Calcutta lawyer and Indian National Congress (also known
                as the Congress Party) politician.</p>
            <h3>Career as a freedom fighter</h3>
            <p>
                In Nazi Germany Bose came under the tutelage of a newly created Special Bureau for India, guided by Adam von Trott zu Solz. On October 21, 1943, Bose proclaimed the establishment of a provisional independent Indian government, and his so-called Indian
                National Army (Azad Hind Fauj), alongside Japanese troops, advanced to Rangoon (Yangon) and thence overland into India, reaching Indian soil on March 18, 1944, and moving into Kohima and the plains of Imphal. In a stubborn battle, the
                mixed Indian and Japanese forces, lacking Japanese air support, were defeated and forced to retreat; the Indian National Army nevertheless for some time succeeded in maintaining its identity as a liberation army, based in Burma and then
                Indochina. With the defeat of Japan, however, Bose’s fortunes ended. A few days after Japan’s announced surrender in August 1945, Bose, fleeing Southeast Asia, reportedly died in a Japanese hospital in Taiwan as a result of burn injuries
                from a plane crash.

            <h3>Political career</h3>
            <p>
                He started the newspaper Swaraj and took charge of publicity for the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee.[93] His mentor was Chittaranjan Das who was a spokesman for aggressive nationalism in Bengal. In the year 1923, Bose was elected the President of
                Indian Youth Congress and also the Secretary of Bengal State Congress.
            </p>
            <h3>Awards and Achievements</h3>
            <p>
                In 1992, the Government of India decided to confer Bharat Ratna to Subhash Chandra Bose, but it was opposed by some members of his family who had refused to accept the fact of his death. In 1938 he was elected president of the Indian National Congress
                and formed a national planning committee, which formulated a policy of broad industrialization. He formed the Azad Hind Fauj, also known as the Indian National Army, or INA.
            </p>
            <h3>Death</h3>
            <p>
                It has been more than 70 years since Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s death, but the questions regarding the circumstances of his demise — the time, year, and location of his passing away — are still shrouded in mystery. We commemorate his death anniversary
                on 18 August every year because, according to some of the significant biographers, Netaji died in a plane crash in Taihoku (Japanese Taiwan) on that day in 1945.
